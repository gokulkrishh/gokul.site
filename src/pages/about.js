				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>
					I'm glad that you made this far to my website. Now let's talk about
					me. I started my career as a self-taught UI Developer using HTML, CSS,
					javascript & PHP. After few months, I got a chance to work on Angular
					(v1.5) and slowly started working on many other javascript frameworks
					like ember, backbone, kendo ui, knockoutjs etc,. In the beginning of
					my career only I understood that I liked working on the web a lot.
				</p>
				<p>
					So I started following my passion and curiosity in the open web,
					focusing on improving my skills as a web developer. Before even I
					realized I became an expert in what I was doing and got nominated for
					Google Developer Expert (GDE). After two discussions with a googler
					and an existing GDE and a few months of waiting, I became a Google
					Developer Expert (GDE) in Web Technologies.
				</p>
				<p>
					As of now, I am continuing my passion towards the web and improving
					myself and helping other fellow web devs. Besides coding, I like
					gaming (COD mobile mostly these days), running, football, traveling
					and finally an author in progress. To know more about my book, follow
					me in{" "}
