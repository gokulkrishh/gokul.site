title: "2019 year end review"
---

Last year I wrote a list of things I wanted to achieve in 2019. So I thought why not I write a blog post every year-end about what I did throughout the year.

This post will be really helpful when I look back and think about what I did and how much I learned every year etc.

## Summary of the year:

- Read 5 books (Reading my last book **Atomic Habits**).
- I started running üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è regularly. So far I have run around 150km.
- Started playing football and badminton.
- Delivered 5 talks.
- Started Waking up early on weekdays (6 AM) (This is my keystone habit).
- I wrote only 1 post ü§™ this year (lazy me).
- Took 3 long breaks (This post is written on the 4th break).
- Contributed to 2 Open Source Projects.
- Created a couple of Open Source Projects.
- Curated & Maintained a newsletter.

### My blog posts

I wrote only 1 article in 2019 üòÜ. In 2020, I am planning to write at least 1 article per month üò¨.

### Git streaks

Once my wise friend [Hemanth](https://twitter.com/gnumanth) told me that git streaks are just gimmicky and all it does is put stress on you and that he stopped doing it. I wanted to stop as well and take breaks whenever I can and I need to.

Hence my streaks look like this.

<p><img style="margin-top: 30px;margin-bottom: 30px;" src="./2019-git-streaks.png" alt="Git Streaks 2019" /></p>

But now looking back I took a lot of breaks üôÑüòÜ and feel great about it.
