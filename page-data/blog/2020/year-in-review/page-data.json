It went well for a few months but then the COVID pandemic hit the world and you know the rest of the story.</p>\n<p>P.S: You might hear me ranting about this COVID pandemic throughout this post and how it affected my progress.

Reading</h4>\n<p>I have to say, I have outdone myself in this category by overachieving it. For this year, my goal was to read 8 books and I am currently reading 11th and 12th book which I will be finishing it before year-end. I am so happy I was able to find time to read more books.</p>\n<p>Find what I read in <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/25595771-gokulakrishnan?date_added=2020&#x26;order=a&#x26;shelf=2020&#x26;visible_control=batchEdit#\">good reads</a>.</p>\n<h4>2. Coding</h4>\n<p>Well, I will let my Github streaks speak for my coding habit. The year 2020, was not easy for many of us and I was struggling to concentrate as this pandemic was wreaking havoc on our planet. And if you read my last year‚Äôs review, like I said this streak doesn‚Äôt matter, and don‚Äôt let it stress you by seeing other‚Äôs streak and for the very reason I have added it here.</p>\n<center>\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/f6550721e406dd7fd594060aed5b40dd/f098e/streaks.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 20.945945945945947%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAECAYAAACOXx+WAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAA/UlEQVQY0x3Oy07DMBSE4b7/k7CmGzaVEAuEkGiB0rTqTS1Jc3ViJ06cOg79MSyONNKRvpnJYB2FKQnbhI90wzxbIbQk0ilJU1DVCmsGpKkJdUzelkRNimobOmMIZcKlyejNFTsMTHrTc5DfvIold7sp03DGPA+YFyvutzOeowWxzNkUR7bViZO68Ca+iOqEdXXkIXjyQ9YorTEenRgP5qpiUQU8xi9kreBQ+4L808MrdurMWcUE5Z7ULxaN5D1ZI1rJdx2zL86USlF3mt560I03qtZRttZjhktt0P2AGXu4gfsZ/68fLW78y47uarj5n7UW0VUssy2lLxqc4xe26SsUz73SBQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"2020 github streaks\" title=\"2020 github streaks\" src=\"/static/f6550721e406dd7fd594060aed5b40dd/fcda8/streaks.png\" srcset=\"/static/f6550721e406dd7fd594060aed5b40dd/12f09/streaks.png 148w,\n/static/f6550721e406dd7fd594060aed5b40dd/e4a3f/streaks.png 295w,\n/static/f6550721e406dd7fd594060aed5b40dd/fcda8/streaks.png 590w,\n/static/f6550721e406dd7fd594060aed5b40dd/efc66/streaks.png 885w,\n/static/f6550721e406dd7fd594060aed5b40dd/c83ae/streaks.png 1180w,\n/static/f6550721e406dd7fd594060aed5b40dd/f098e/streaks.png 1506w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n</center>\n<h4>3.

Writing a book - Beginner‚Äôs Guide To Web Security</h4>\n<p>I never thought I will write a book in my lifetime, the main reason is I am lazy. But during the pandemic, I got inspired by so many people who were using their time during the lockdown by writing books, blogs, etc. So I thought why not? So I took a topic which I was least interested in and less known to me. I am glad I was able to finish it within a month.</p>\n<p>To celebrate my achievement in writing a book, I am giving away 5 free book copies. Use this coupon <strong>yeahiwroteabook</strong>. And if you were not able to grab a free copy, don‚Äôt worry my book will be sold for a 50% offer for a week. Click the above book link on top to purchase it now.</p>\n<p>And I want to thank the people who bought my book.</p>\n<p><strong>Stats:</strong></p>\n<p>So far I have made around ~200$ and it‚Äôs not just about the money but it is an incentive for me to keep going.</p>\n<h4>5. Physical activities</h4>\n<p>I am a football player or used to be and it is my fav sport (‚öΩÔ∏è Barcelona) somehow I was able to play around 10+ games this year before the pandemic. My most enjoyable physical activity was running. And for me running was sort of an acquired habit.</p>\n<h5>Some stats on my activities:</h5>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Total Runs:</strong> 60</li>\n<li><strong>Total Kilometer:</strong> 159.9</li>\n<li><strong>Running Workouts:</strong> 92</li>\n<li><strong>Badminton:</strong> 7+ games (Thanks to my friends)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>6. Speaking:</h4>\n<p>I couldn‚Äôt speak this year at all, last year I spoke 5+ times and this year it is just 1 talk. That‚Äôs it.</p>\n<h4>7. Learn a new language:</h4>\n<p>I am a big anime fan, I tried learning Japanese just so I can watch the anime without English subtitles but I couldn‚Äôt progress much but on the brighter side, I can understand 25% of Japanese now, and before it was 0%.</p>\n<h4>8. Breaks</h4>\n<p>I took 4 long breaks and I am exhausted from my leaves for this year as well. It‚Äôs 0 now yaas it is zero.</p>\n<h3>Goals for 2021</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Reading (12 books &#x26; many more blog posts)</li>\n<li>More Coding &#x26; Pet Projects (I have so many ideas for a pet project, ping me if you want to collaborate with me)</li>\n<li>Writing Blogs &#x26; Newsletters (I will continue how it works series and will add more posts to my blog)</li>\n<li>Books (Yas I am planning to write one more book, subscribe to my newsletter to know more)</li>\n<li>Physical activities (more running at least 200 KM‚Äôs)</li>\n<li>Speaking (at-least 5)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks for reading this post and subscribe to my newsletter for more updates about my upcoming new book and pet projects.
