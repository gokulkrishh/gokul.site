				<h2>A little about me:</h2>
				<p>
					I'm glad you made this far to the website. So thank you for that. Now
					let's talk about me. I started my career as a UI Developer who knows
					HTML, CSS, little JS & PHP. After moving to my 2nd company, I started
					working on many javascript frameworks & web technologies. Then I
					slowly understood that I liked working on the web a lot.
				</p>
				<p>
					So I started following my passion and curiosity in the open web,
					focusing on improving my skills as a web developer. I before even
					realizing I became an expert in what I was doing and got nominated for
					Google Developer Expert. Finally, I became a Google Developer Expert
					(GDE) in Web Technologies.
				</p>
				<p>
					As of now, I am continuing my passion towards the web and improving
					myself and helping other fellow web devs.
