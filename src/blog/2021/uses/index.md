## Computer

I'm using macOS for close to 7 years now. An Intel version for work and an [M1 chip version](https://www.apple.com/in/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/13-inch) for personal use. The M1 MacBook pro is absolutely a beast. Battery life is great, performance is top-notch. 4k 10mins video export takes only 5 mins in iMovie, where it took 30m in intel MacBook pro.

## Coding

#### Terminal

- [Iterm 2](https://iterm2.com/) as default terminal app.
- [Iterm 2 Profile](https://github.com/gokulkrishh/dotfiles/blob/master/Default.iterm2.json) file, just import and start using this.
- [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) for default shell.
- [Customized verion](https://github.com/gokulkrishh/dotfiles/blob/master/Dracula.terminal) of [dracula theme](https://draculatheme.com/) for the iterm app.

#### Code Editor
