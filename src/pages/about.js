					<h2>Hi, I'm Gokul üëã</h2>
					<p>
						I'm glad that you made this far to my website. Now let's talk about
						me. I started my career as a self-taught Web Developer by learning HTML,
						CSS, javascript & PHP. After a few months, I got a chance to work on
						a Javascript framework (Angular v1.5) and later few months down the line, I started working on
						other javascript frameworks like ember, backbone, kendo ui,
						knockoutjs etc, in different projects. In the beginning of my career only, I understood
						that I liked working on the web a lot.
					</p>
					<p>
						So I started following my passion and curiosity in the open web,
						focusing on improving my skills as a web developer. Before even I
						realized I became an expert in what I was doing and got nominated
						for Google Developer Expert (GDE). After two round of discussions with a
						googler and an existing GDE and a few months of waiting, I became a
						<a

							target="_blank"
						>
							Google Developer Expert
						</a>{" "}
						for Web Technologies.
					</p>
					<p>
						As of now, I am continuing my passion towards the web and improving
						the web by building tools and helping other fellow web developers.
						Besides coding, I like gaming (COD mobile mostly these days),
						running, football, traveling and an author, check out my book{" "}
						<a href="/book">Beginners guide to web security</a>.
